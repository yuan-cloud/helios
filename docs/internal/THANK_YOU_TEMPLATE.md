**Subject:** Thank you for MCP Agent Mail — Used it to build HELIOS!

Hey [Friend's Name]!

I wanted to reach out and thank you for creating **MCP Agent Mail**. I just finished building **[HELIOS](https://github.com/yuan-cloud/helios)** — a 3D code visualization tool — and I used MCP Agent Mail to coordinate 5 AI agents throughout the entire development process.

## The Results

The coordination system worked flawlessly:
- **341 commits** across 5 agents
- **Zero merge conflicts** (file reservations prevented all conflicts)
- **Complete audit trail** in Git (every message is a commit)
- **Perfect coordination** between parser, viz, embeddings, graph, and storage agents

## What I'm Planning

I want to make sure you get proper credit for creating such an innovative system:

1. ✅ **Added attribution** in HELIOS README with link to your repo
2. 📝 **Writing a blog post** about the multi-agent development process
3. 🐦 **Sharing on social media** with proper credit to MCP Agent Mail
4. 📚 **Created documentation** explaining how we used it (docs/MCP_AGENT_MAIL_SHARING.md)

## Would You Be Open To...

- Adding HELIOS as a **use case/example** in your MCP Agent Mail repo?
- Me creating a **PR with a case study** documenting the experience?
- **Cross-promoting** both projects (your coordination system + my visualization tool)?

## Why This Matters

This is a **real-world proof** that MCP Agent Mail works at scale. The fact that 5 agents built a production-ready application with zero conflicts demonstrates the power of your coordination system.

I believe both projects can benefit from this collaboration:
- **MCP Agent Mail** gets a concrete case study showing it works
- **HELIOS** gets to showcase innovative multi-agent development
- **The community** learns about a new approach to AI-assisted development

## Next Steps

I'm happy to:
- Open an issue in your repo sharing the case study
- Create a PR adding HELIOS to examples/use-cases
- Collaborate on documentation or blog posts
- Help promote MCP Agent Mail in any way that makes sense

Thanks again for building something amazing! MCP Agent Mail enabled something that would have been impossible otherwise.

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** If you'd like to see HELIOS in action, I can share the demo URL once it's deployed. The coordination process is also fully documented in our Git history — every agent message is a commit!
