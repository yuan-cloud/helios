### Option 1: Technical Deep-Dive

```
🧵 I just launched HELIOS — a 3D code visualization tool built entirely in the browser.

But here's what makes it unique: it was built by 5 coordinated AI agents working in parallel.

1/ The Challenge:
   - Parser agent (AST parsing)
   - Viz agent (3D visualization)  
   - Embeddings agent (semantic analysis)
   - Graph agent (network metrics)
   - Storage agent (persistence)

How do you coordinate 5 agents without conflicts?

2/ The Solution: MCP Agent Mail by @Dicklesworthstone
   
   A coordination system that provides:
   - File reservations (prevents conflicts)
   - Message coordination (agents communicate)
   - Git audit trail (full transparency)
   
   Result: 341 commits, ZERO merge conflicts.

3/ Real Example:
   When embeddings agent finished similarity computation, it sent a message:
   "[DONE] Similarity edges ready, schema-compliant"
   
   Graph agent received it, reviewed, integrated, confirmed.
   All automatically. All visible in Git.

4/ The Tech Stack:
   - WebAssembly (Tree-sitter, SQLite, ONNX)
   - WebGPU acceleration
   - OPFS persistent storage
   - 100% client-side (privacy-first)
   - Zero backend

5/ What I Learned:
   - Multi-agent development works at scale
   - Coordination is key
   - File reservations prevent conflicts
   - Message history is invaluable
   - The future is collaborative AI

### Option 2: Story-Driven (More Viral)

```
🚀 Just launched HELIOS — and it has a wild backstory.

I wanted to build a 3D code visualization tool. But I had a problem: I needed 5 specialized AI agents to work together.

Enter MCP Agent Mail by @Dicklesworthstone — a coordination system that changed everything.

🧵 Thread:

1/ The Problem:
   Building HELIOS required:
   - AST parsing (Tree-sitter)
   - Semantic embeddings (Transformers.js)
   - Graph analysis (Graphology)
   - 3D visualization (Three.js)
   - Persistent storage (SQLite-WASM)
   
   Each needs a specialized agent. How do you coordinate them?

2/ The Solution:
   MCP Agent Mail provides:
   - File reservations (agents claim files before editing)
   - Message coordination (agents communicate)
   - Git audit trail (every message is a commit)
   
   Think "Gmail for coding agents"

3/ The Results:
   - 341 commits
   - ZERO merge conflicts
   - Complete transparency
   - All coordination visible in Git
   
   This is proof that multi-agent development works.

4/ The Tech:
   - 100% client-side
   - WebAssembly + WebGPU
   - Privacy-first (no data uploads)
   - Works entirely in browser

5/ Try it: [YOUR_DEMO_URL]
   
   Special thanks to @Dicklesworthstone for MCP Agent Mail — this wouldn't have been possible without it.

Excited to share HELIOS — a 3D code visualization tool that I built entirely in the browser.

What makes this unique isn't just the technology (WebAssembly, WebGPU, OPFS), but how it was built: by 5 coordinated AI agents working in parallel.

The Challenge:
Building HELIOS required specialized agents for:
- AST parsing (Tree-sitter)
- Semantic embeddings (Transformers.js)
- Graph analysis (Graphology)
- 3D visualization (Three.js)
- Persistent storage (SQLite-WASM)

The Solution:
I used MCP Agent Mail — a coordination system created by [Friend's Name] — that enabled:
- File reservations (prevents conflicts)
- Message coordination (agents communicate)
- Git audit trail (full transparency)

The Results:
- 341 commits
- Zero merge conflicts
- Complete audit trail
- Production-ready application

This is a real-world proof that multi-agent development can work at scale.

Special thanks to [Friend's Name] for creating MCP Agent Mail — this project wouldn't have been possible without it.
