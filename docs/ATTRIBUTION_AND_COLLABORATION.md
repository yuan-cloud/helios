# Attribution & Collaboration: MCP Agent Mail

## Acknowledgment

HELIOS was built using **[MCP Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail)** — a coordination system that enabled 5 AI agents to work together seamlessly on this project.

## How MCP Agent Mail Enabled HELIOS

Without MCP Agent Mail, coordinating 5 specialized AI agents would have been impossible. The system provided:

- **File Reservations**: Prevented conflicts when agents edited the same files
- **Message Coordination**: Enabled agents to communicate and share context
- **Audit Trail**: All coordination visible in Git commits
- **Zero Conflicts**: 341 commits with zero merge conflicts

This is a **real-world proof** that MCP Agent Mail works for complex, multi-agent development.

## Attribution Strategy

### MCP Agent Mail

HELIOS was built using **[MCP Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail)** — a coordination system that enabled 5 AI agents to work together seamlessly.

**Created by:** [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone)

Without MCP Agent Mail, coordinating multiple AI agents would have been impossible. The system provided file reservations, message coordination, and a complete audit trail — enabling 341 commits with zero merge conflicts.

**Learn more:** See [docs/MCP_AGENT_MAIL_SHARING.md](docs/MCP_AGENT_MAIL_SHARING.md) for details on how it works.

### 2. Create a Twitter/X Thread

```
🧵 How I built HELIOS — a 3D code visualization tool — using 5 coordinated AI agents

1/ HELIOS visualizes codebases as interactive 3D graphs. But here's what makes it unique: it was built by 5 AI agents working in parallel.

2/ The challenge: How do you coordinate 5 agents without conflicts?
   - Parser agent (AST parsing)
   - Viz agent (3D visualization)
   - Embeddings agent (semantic analysis)
   - Graph agent (network analysis)
   - Storage agent (persistence)

3/ Solution: MCP Agent Mail by @Dicklesworthstone
   - File reservations prevent conflicts
   - Message coordination for context
   - Git audit trail for transparency
   - Result: 341 commits, ZERO conflicts

4/ Real example: When embeddings agent finished similarity computation, it sent a message to graph agent. Graph agent reviewed, integrated, and confirmed — all automatically.

5/ This is a proof that multi-agent development can work at scale. Both projects are open source:
   - HELIOS: [your repo]
   - MCP Agent Mail: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail

6/ What I learned:
   - Coordination is key
   - File reservations prevent conflicts
   - Message history is invaluable
   - Multi-agent development is the future

Try HELIOS: [your demo URL]
```

### 3. Create a Video/Demo

**Content:**

- Explain the multi-agent development process
- Show MCP Agent Mail coordination
- Demonstrate file reservations
- Show message history in Git

**Where to share:**
- YouTube

- LinkedIn
- Reddit (r/programming, r/webdev)

### 4. Submit to Showcases

**Where to submit:**
- **GitHub Showcase**: "Projects using MCP Agent Mail"

4. **Be transparent**
   - Don't claim you built the coordination system
   - Clearly show what's yours vs. what's theirs
   - Share the collaboration story

5. **Make it win-win**
   - Your project showcases their work
   - Their work enables your project
   - Both benefit from visibility

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't claim credit** for MCP Agent Mail

5. **Don't be competitive** — collaboration benefits everyone

## Example: Perfect Attribution

### In README.md

```markdown
## Built With

- **MCP Agent Mail** — Multi-agent coordination system
  - Created by: [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone)
  - Repository: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail
  - **How we used it**: Coordinated 5 AI agents to build HELIOS
  - **Results**: 341 commits, zero merge conflicts, complete audit trail
```

### In Blog Post

```markdown
## The Coordination Challenge

Building HELIOS required 5 specialized AI agents:
- Parser agent (AST parsing)
- Visualization agent (3D rendering)
- Embeddings agent (semantic analysis)
- Graph agent (network metrics)
- Storage agent (persistence)

Coordinating these agents without conflicts seemed impossible — until we discovered **MCP Agent Mail**.

**MCP Agent Mail** (created by [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone)) provides a coordination layer that enables multiple AI agents to work together seamlessly. It offers:

- File reservations to prevent conflicts
- Message-based coordination
- Git audit trail
- Searchable conversation history

**The results speak for themselves**: 341 commits, zero merge conflicts, and a complete audit trail of all agent coordination.

Hey [Friend's Name]!

I wanted to let you know that I just finished building HELIOS — a 3D code visualization tool — and I used MCP Agent Mail to coordinate 5 AI agents throughout the entire development process.

The results were incredible:
- 341 commits
- Zero merge conflicts
- Complete audit trail in Git
- All agents worked in perfect coordination

I'm planning to:
1. Add prominent attribution in the README
2. Write a blog post about the multi-agent development process
3. Share it on social media with proper credit to MCP Agent Mail
4. Open an issue in your repo to share the case study

Would you be open to me:
- Adding HELIOS as a use case/example in your repo?
- Creating a PR with a case study?
- Cross-promoting both projects?

This is a real-world proof that MCP Agent Mail works at scale, and I want to make sure you get proper credit for creating such an innovative system.

Thanks for building something amazing!
