## 📄 MCP Agent Mail Documentation

I've created **`docs/MCP_AGENT_MAIL_SHARING.md`** — a shareable document explaining:

- What MCP Agent Mail is
- How it enabled multi-agent development
- Real examples from HELIOS development
- How to use it
- Why it matters for employers

**This document is perfect for:**
- Sharing with potential employers
- Explaining your development process
- Demonstrating understanding of AI coordination
- Showing advanced system design skills

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

```bash
# Commit any pending changes
git add .
git commit -m "Production deployment ready"
git push origin main

# Then follow docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
# Or use DEPLOY_QUICKSTART.md for step-by-step
```

### 2. Portfolio Presentation

1. **Live Demo**: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
2. **Screenshots**: Capture impressive visualizations
3. **Technical Blog**: Write about WebAssembly/WebGPU
4. **GitHub**: Your README is now professional
5. **MCP Agent Mail Doc**: Share `docs/MCP_AGENT_MAIL_SHARING.md`

### 3. Share with Employers
